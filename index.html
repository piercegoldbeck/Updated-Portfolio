    <h2><u>Projects That I Have Worked On</u></h2>
    <p>Throughout my time as a software enginner, I have worked on three projects that have helped me understand the basics of front-end and backend web development. 
        The first project was a blog that was created using EJS, express and Mongoose. 
        The second project was a blog created using the MERN Stack way of development.
        The thrid project was also created using the MERN stack way of development and including a third party API in order to add some cool photos for users to see and interact with on their end. </p>
